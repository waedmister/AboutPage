        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>-----</p>
        <p class="Mystory">I left high school thinking I wanted to be an interior designer renovating homes. My second semester in college was difficult since I had little formal exposure to design. Rather than reach out for help, I changed my major two more times. I earned my first MS in Vocational and Technical Education and taught/coached middle and high school. My second teaching role was as an Instructional Technology Facilatator. I really enjoyed this job utilizing technology within education.
        Unfortunately, the position ended with the grant completion. I went back to school earning a second MS in Counseling and Human Development. From 2005-2016, I have worked in higher education providing student support, mainly as an Academic Advisor. While I have had much fulfillment knowing I have positively impacted the lives of hundreds of students, I am looking to change my line of work, which explains my enrollment in the Iron Yard's User Interface course.</p>

          <h2>Web Design Inspiration</h2>
          <p>-----</p>
          <p class="Designinspiration">I have been flirting with the idea of leaving education since 2013. In the fall of 2015, I left my job at NCSU and worked full-time on renovating my home in North Raleigh with the intention of selling it. I painted the exterior, interior, and landscaped the yard. Work I could not complete myself, I contracted out. In January I started an Academic Advisor position at ECU. Each weekend I drove back to Raleigh to continue doing work on my home. In the spring of 2016 I had six offers over the listing price. It sold 36 hours after it went live on MLS. Photos to the left are taken by the Tour Factory which were key to my house selling as quickly as it did. The take away for me is that I absolutely loved seeing the results of my hardwork. The work was creative and design-focused. Breaking into the saturated market of home contracting was not appealing. However, webdesign, really piqued my interest. I have dabbled in programming through a course in college and did a little HTML in my jobs before. Now, I am enrolled in the Iron Yard's course and loving it!!!</p>
